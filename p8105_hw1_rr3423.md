## PROBLEM 1

``` r

  random_sample = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = random_sample > 0,

``` r
# taking the mean of each variable in the dataframe
mean_random_sample = mean(pull(prob_one_df, random_sample))

mean_vec_logical = mean(pull(prob_one_df, vec_logical))

mean_vec_character = mean(pull(prob_one_df, vec_character))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob_one_df, vec_character)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_vec_factor = mean(pull(prob_one_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob_one_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

When attempting to take the mean of each variable in the dataframe, it
was possible to successfully take the mean of the random sample variable
and the mean of the logical variable. It was not possible to take the
mean of the character variable or the mean of the factor variable.

``` r
# Applying the as.numeric function to the logical, character, and factor variables 
convert_logical = as.numeric(pull(prob_one_df, vec_logical))

convert_character = as.numeric(pull(prob_one_df, vec_character))

convert_factor = as.numeric(pull(prob_one_df, vec_factor))
```

Converting the logical variable works because using the as.numeric
function converts the “TRUE” and “FALSE” logical values to “1” and “0”
numeric values. This helps explain why it is possible to take the mean
of the logical variable because the logical values can be converted to
numeric values..

Converting the character variable using the as.numeric function does not
work because there are only character strings in the character variable,
and character strings cannot directly be converted to numeric values.
This is why there is a warning message that “NAs introduced by coercion”
because R failed to convert the character strings to numeric values.
This helps explain why it is not possible to take the mean of the
character variable.

Converting the factor variable using the as.numeric function does not
give the expected output. This conversion only provides the factor
levels, but not the numeric values contained in the factor vector. This
is because the factor variable is in character format. This explains why
it is not possible to get the mean of the factor variable.

## PROBLEM 2

``` r
# loading dataset 
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

-   The **important variables** in the penguins dataset are species,
    island, bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm,
    body\_mass\_g, sex, year.

-   The **species** in the penguins dataset are Adelie, Gentoo,
    Chinstrap.

-   The **islands** in the penguins dataset are Torgersen, Biscoe,
    Dream.

-   The **sex** in the penguins dataset are male, female.

-   The **years** in the penguins dataset are 2007, 2008, 2009.

-   The **mean** of the bill length is 43.92. The **standard deviation**
    of the bill length is 5.46.

-   The **mean** of the bill depth is 17.15. The **standard deviation**
    of the bill depth is 1.97.

-   The **mean** of the flipper length is 200.92. The **standard
    deviation** of the flipper length is 14.06.

-   The **mean** of the body mass is 4201.75. The **standard deviation**
    of the body mass is 801.95.

-   The **number of rows** in the penguins dataset is 344.

-   The **number of columns** in the penguins dataset is 8.

``` r
# making scatterplot for flipper length and bill length
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("Flipper Length vs. Bill Length")
